## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Extract AMQP setup logic into core package

  This release introduces a new `@amqp-contract/core` package that centralizes AMQP infrastructure setup logic. The core package provides a `setupInfra` function that handles the creation of exchanges, queues, and bindings, eliminating code duplication across client and worker packages.

  **New Features:**

  - New `@amqp-contract/core` package with centralized AMQP setup logic
  - `setupInfra` function for creating exchanges, queues, and bindings from contract definitions

  **Changes:**

  - Updated `@amqp-contract/client` to use core setup function
  - Updated `@amqp-contract/worker` to use core setup function
  - All packages are now versioned together as a fixed group

  **Migration:**
  No breaking changes. Existing code will continue to work as before. The core package is used internally by client and worker packages.
